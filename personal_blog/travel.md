# Travel Blog - Gabriel Montes
## Dates December 2025 - June 2026

Welcome to my travel blog. Here is just a space to journal my thouhgts, and expeiences from January 2026 until I begin full time work in August 2026. I plan to journal here on my experiences in the different countries that I visit during this time and on any thoughts that I feel worth writing down. I was always weakest in english and composition type classes going through school so my expectations are low for my writing in this blog, however I want to take this blog as a chance to develop those skills because I do feel that composition is a powerful and useful skill.

## Location 1 - Leadville, Colorado, USA

After graduating and spending time with my family up until Christmas, I left for Colorado to couch surf with friends in Leadville, Colorado. Leadville is located near Copper Mountain, a popular ski resort, where I plan to snowboard most days while here. Having had these friends for a while, I have already visited the mountains twice before to learn how to snowboard and meet many friends of my friends.

I spent the last few days mostly snowboarding or actively spending time with friends (playing board games, playing bar games, drinking, eating, watching shows and watching movies). When I catch myself awake when nobody else is, I would leave to a local coffee shop to work on developing this blog and doing technical work for fun. Many of the people in my social circle around leadville work at Copper Mountain, which has much of its work in maintaining the skiing areas done at night, so their sleep schedules are pretty crazy. My friends are really into pro football unlike me thus giving me plenty of down time to also build this website and code while ignoring the borderline gluttunous amount of football that these guys can watch on Sundays.

Happy New Year! Of course, I spent the night out with friends at a local bar in Leadville called Past Times. The local history of the Leadville as an old western mining town is really visible in almost every part of the town and it is very aestethic. This was super noticable at Past Times with the classic bar games like pool, darts, and shuffleboard in the far half of the bar and a typical college bar in the near half to the entrance with crappy mixed drinks, a young crowd and an EDM DJ setup with strobelights and loudspeakers contrasting the old western saloon aestethic of the building itself. Things also felt different being in a small town with something like 80% of the people there being at most one degree of seperation from me through my handful of local friends. This almost made the bar feel more like a frat party where everyone can claim some relation to each other through knowing a brother where all I had to do was name drop 'Titatanium Joe' and someone will probably know who I am.

I woke up earlier than the others today, like I typically do, so I came to my favorite local cafe, City on a Hill, and wrote up this post. I cataloged a few mathy type blogs that I want to read as I spend my time exploring math and programming for fun. It's about time for me to go skiing and I'm hoping my writing will become more effortless so I can both develop these skills and write these posts more efficiently and in less time leaving me to do coding math and language stuff. 

### January 2 2026

Today I am actually trying to build my optimal routine in Leadville for maximizing the value that I get out of this month. I intentially woke up early, so I could come to my cafe and do a little math or programming after I finish writing up this post. We got a few inches of snow, so I am excited about the snowboarding conditions on the mountain. I am trying to leave this cafe around 8am to try and get to the mountain before all of the fresh snow gets skiied out by the other skiiers. 

I've been thinking a good bit about the necesity of discipline for leading a fulfilling life. I have a season pass across many ski resorts so it does not bother me too much to show up to the mountain late and only get a handful of runs down the mountain and take a more chill day. For completely avoidable reasons, we got to the mountain around 2:15pm when skiing closes at 4pm and some friends of friends had buy full day passes(at a discount) for full day prices. I bring this up not to try and shame anyone or anything, but to add context that this experience shows me that I think these avoidable reasons just boiled down to lacking discipline and being lazy about getting up to go skiing and organizing logistics beforehand.

 We normally think about discipline as something that you use to achieve your goals; sticking to a workout regiment, eating less tasty but more healthy food, and finishing up your work when you really want to go home and watch netflix. This seems to be the typical un-fun examples of discipline that come to mind where we do something unpleasant that we know is good for us, figuratively 'eating our vegetables'. However, I want to clarify to myself the idea that discipline is also necessary to wake up early to have a great day skiing, to chose to read your favorite book instead of mindlessly scrolling instagram and, for me, walk through the cold to my favorite cafe instead of sitting on the couch and binging my fifth rewatch of the Fallout show. Here dicipline still gives us some level of discomfort to realize some net gain in value, but it seems like the idea that we tie discipline solely to the discomfortable part of these decisions is leaving out a critical part of the equation. This makes me think that discipline should not be viewed as simply paying now and making yourself uncomfortable to realize some immaterial gain just because we 'should', in the 'eating your vegetables' idea that normally comes to mind. Rather discipline allows us to extract leveraged value from forfitting simple discomforts. Thus to me, it is more useful and accurate to view discipline as our strength to excert our own will power to reach for the things that we want. 
 
 Furthermore, this view on discipline seems most consistent with my outlook on my own current situation in life. Intuitively, it is obvious that I should not waste this unique time in my life where I have youth, extended freetime and self financing by bed-rotting on my phone and binging 100 different shows, but I should exert my will on my life through discipline and go travel to see friends, wake up early to go skiing and spend my money on these great experiences when I would rather save it(potential future essay idea for my thoughts on money). Contrary to the popular concensus on discipline, from my reasoning I should take this time off and the uniqueness of this time in my life to go out and be as disciplined as possible so that I can gain as much value out of this time rather than just 'take it easy'.
