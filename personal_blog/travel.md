## Dates December 2025 - June 2026

Welcome to my travel blog. Here is just a space to share my travels and thouhgts on the different countries that I visit during my free time that I will have before starting work in August of 2026. 

## Location 1 - Leadville, Colorado, USA

After graduating and spending time with my family up until Christmas, I left for Colorado to couch surf with friends in Leadville, Colorado. Leadville is located near Copper Mountain, a popular ski resort, where I plan to snowboard most days while here. Having had these friends for a while, I have already visited the mountains twice before to learn how to snowboard and meet many friends of my friends.

### December 12/31

I spent the last few days mostly snowboarding or actively spending time with friends (playing board games, playing bar games, drinking, eating, watching shows and watching movies). When I catch myself awake when nobody else is, I would leave to a local coffee shop to work on developing this blog and doing technical work for fun. Many of the people in my social circle around leadville work at Copper Mountain, which has much of its work in maintaining the skiing areas done at night, so their sleep schedules are pretty crazy.
