# Travel Blog - Gabriel Montes
## Dates December 2025 - June 2026

Welcome to my travel blog. Here is just a space to journal my thouhgts, and expeiences from January 2026 until I begin full time work in August 2026. I plan to journal here on my experiences in the different countries that I visit during this time and on any thoughts that I feel worth writing down. I was always weakest in english and composition type classes going through school so my expectations are low for my writing in this blog, however I want to take this blog as a chance to develop those skills because I do feel that composition is a powerful and useful skill. I'll occasionally write an essay on a topic if I really feel like it.

## Location 1 - Leadville, Colorado, USA

After graduating and spending time with my family up until Christmas, I left for Colorado to couch surf with friends in Leadville, Colorado. Leadville is located near Copper Mountain, a popular ski resort, where I plan to snowboard most days while here. Having had these friends for a while, I have already visited the mountains twice before to learn how to snowboard and meet many friends of my friends.

### December 31 2025 - Wednesday

I spent the last few days mostly snowboarding or actively spending time with friends (playing board games, playing bar games, drinking, eating, watching shows and watching movies). When I catch myself awake when nobody else is, I would leave to a local coffee shop to work on developing this blog and doing technical work for fun. Many of the people in my social circle around leadville work at Copper Mountain, which has much of its work in maintaining the skiing areas done at night, so their sleep schedules are pretty crazy. My friends are really into pro football unlike me thus giving me plenty of down time to also build this website and code while ignoring the borderline gluttunous amount of football that these guys can watch on Sundays. 

### January 1 2026 - Thursday

Happy New Year! Of course, I spent the night out with friends at a local bar in Leadville called Past Times. The local history of the Leadville as an old western mining town is really visible in almost every part of the town. This was super noticable at Past Times with the classic bar games like pool, darts, and shuffleboard in the far half of the bar and a typical college bar in the near half to the entrance with crappy mixed drinks, a young crowd and an EDM DJ setup with strobelights and loudspeakers contrasting the old western saloon aestethic of the building. Things also felt different being in a small town with most people there being at most one degree of seperation from me through my handful of local friends. This  made the bar feel more like a frat party where everyone has some relation to each other through knowing a brother where all I had to do was name drop 'Titatanium Joe', and someone will probably know who I am.

I woke up earlier than the others today, like I typically do, so I came to my favorite local cafe, City on a Hill, and wrote up this post. I cataloged a few mathy type blogs that I want to read as I spend my time exploring math and programming for fun. It's about time for me to go skiing and I'm hoping my writing will become more effortless so I can both develop these skills and write these posts more efficiently leaving me to do coding, math and language stuff. 

### January 2 2026 - Friday

Today, I am actually trying to build my optimal routine in Leadville for maximizing the value that I get out of this month. I intentially woke up early, so I could come to my cafe and do a little math or programming after I finish writing up this post. We got a few inches of snow, so I am excited about the snowboarding conditions on the mountain. I am trying to leave this cafe around 8am to try and get to the mountain before all of the fresh snow gets skiied out by the other skiiers. 

#### Thoughts on discipline

I've been thinking a good bit about the necesity of discipline for leading a fulfilling life. I have a season pass across many ski resorts so it does not bother me too much to show up to the mountain late and only get a handful of runs down the mountain and take a more chill day. For completely avoidable reasons, we got to the mountain around 2:15pm when skiing closes at 4pm and some friends of friends had to buy full day passes for full day prices to get about a eighth of a day of skiing. I bring this up not to try and shame anyone, but to add context that this experience shows me that I think these avoidable reasons just boiled down to lacking discipline and being lazy about getting up to go skiing and organizing logistics beforehand. Normally, people would argue that you can take a break from being disciplined when on vacation, but this experience seems to point to the opposite. 

 We normally think about discipline as something painful that you use to achieve your goals; sticking to a workout regiment, eating less tasty but more healthy food, and finishing up your work when you really want to go home and watch netflix. This seems to be the typical un-fun examples of discipline that come to mind where we do something unpleasant that we know is good for us, figuratively 'eating our vegetables'. However, I want to clarify to myself the idea that discipline is also necessary to wake up early to have a great day skiing, to chose to read your favorite book instead of mindlessly scrolling instagram and, for me, walk through the cold to my favorite cafe instead of sitting on the couch and binging my fifth rewatch of the Fallout show. Here dicipline still gives us some level of discomfort to realize some net gain in value, but it seems like the idea that we tie discipline solely to the discomfortable part of these decisions is leaving out a critical part of the equation. This makes me think that discipline should not be tied only to the act of paying, but we should try to associate it more with the pleasant parts where we reap the rewards of our discipline. More formally, discipline allows us to extract leveraged value from accepting some discomforts. Thus to me, it is more useful and accurate to view discipline as our strength to excert our own will power to reach for the things that we want. 
 
 Furthermore, this view on discipline seems most consistent with my outlook on my own current situation in life. Intuitively, it is obvious that I should not waste this unique time in my life where I have youth, extended freetime and financing by bed-rotting on my phone and binging 100 different shows, but I should exert my will on my life through discipline and go travel to see friends, wake up early to go skiing and spend my money on these great experiences when I would rather save or invest it. Contrary to the popular concensus on discipline, from my reasoning, I should take this time off and the uniqueness of this time in my life to go out and be as disciplined as possible so that I can gain as much value out of this time rather than just 'take it easy' like I saw my friends do when they dragged their feet getting to the skiing. 

### January 3 2026 - Saturday

I woke up early joined one of the friends roommates onto the slopes. I am confident snowboarding and controlling myself as I go down the mountain. The next step for me is to work on riding switch which is the opposite orientation as I am used to, gain confident hitting small jumps, and attempting a jump switch where you just jump up and do a 180 degree turn. We snowboarded for about 3 runs before the line for one lift started would stretch to another lift. We both have Ikon season passes so we just called it and got home after a light day of snowboarding before noon.

I learned there is a pretty nice gym that is walking distance from me so I'll likely buy a membership and soon. Most of the people in Leadville that I know work on weekends so there is not a lot to do tonight. 

### January 4 2026 - Sunday

Most people that I know are taking a break from skiing to watch football today since they ski most of the season anyways. This works for me since I recently have gained a good bit of confidence skiing and I started snowboarding more intensely. Because of this, my muscles and joints are feeling more sore so a day off will do me some good. 

I also noticed a good bit of large promotions in sports betting ads that I would see in the football my friends were watching. Exploiting these promotions to give myself arb or a positive EV to finance my future travels seems like a valuable exercise dealing with variance and market mechanics leading into my trading job. 

I am fully aware that these promotions are designed to get people hooked on gambling and I am confident that I can analyze and intellectualize these bets to the point where it will feel like homework thus taking the addictive thrill out of gambling. Also since I intend to view this as an academic exercise I will likely be gambling on events that are more obscure which I do NOT plan to watch, unless I can find a compelling reason to bet on popular events(i.e tighter spreads). This will likely also cut down on the addictivness of the gambling and even if these bets are being placed on popular events like the super bowl I plan to arb out any risk so that I am hedged given the outcome and I only collect the edge that is guaranteed from my strategy. This strategy will only work while I am in Colorado since gambling on these sites are only legal in certain states, so after a month, when I leave Colorado, I must cash out and stop sports bettin. This will likely give me enough time to exploit the new "customer" offers and not give enough time for the gambling sites to catch on to my activities and thus ban me. I will publish my strategy and thoughts in a technical blog post, so look there if you would like to see more about my approach to this. 

### January 5 2026 - Monday

Decent out on the mountain. I was able to hitch a ride to and from the mountain around the beginning and end of the day so I spent the whole day snowboarding and listening to 'flash boys' on audio book. It's just nerdy enough to stop me from giving off any cool ski bum vibes. My friends and I went to a local steakhouse, Quincy's, and had an incredible meal for like 30$ with watermelon margaritas that were unnecessarily good. The restaurant had one thing on the menu: Steak. The menu did give us the option of 4 sizes, how well done we want it, and that was it. The cut of steak is determined by the weekday and that is my favorite type of restaurant.  

### January 6 2026 - Tuesday

It was still my friend's weekend and it snowed the night before so everyone was excited to go to the mountain and enjoy the 'pow day'. I enjoyed the powder and got worked super hard going over moguls. I then let myself get talked into going to another local restaurant, The Famous. This is one of my favorite Italian restaurant(including the one's I visited in Italy). It was a good meal even though I was sore I got to come home and fall off rainbow road while playing Mario Kart with the roommates of where I was staying.

### January 7 2026 - Wednesday

I was sore and had plenty of skiing so I skipped going to Copper Mountain. I decided to actual implement the sports betting arbitraging strategy to exploit new player promotions. It was pretty scary moving around the amount of money that I was moving, but I ended up making a tidy profit on a few promos.

 I also got more comfortable making smaller plays for little bits of arbitrage across sites which is good because I am going to need to make much bigger plays with some of the larger promos before these sites figure out what I am doing and ban me. My goals are to analyze data to find a way to smartly gamble short parlay's which these sites like to advertise a lot because parlays make a lot of money for these sites(and lose a lot for their customers). I also want to find a scheme for trading live. Live trading seems more risky as the numbers are moving constantly and execution speed is both crucial and limited, making it a good exercise. I will not trade anything besides arbitrage on promos until I thoroughly understand these other bet types and make a technical post about it.

### January 8 2026 - Thursday

The plan was, I wake up, go to a coffee shop, snowboard a little, hitch a ride back to Leadville, do some coding or math. I went to City on a Hill, snowboarded for about 2 or 3 hours. I went off my first park jump with the technique of a 5 year old. Then I did some normal snowboarding and had a pretty bad fall. I was going around 20-25mph, by my guess, and I must have caught my front edge trying a little ollie, and suddenly I was sliding face down on some packed snow with my limbs making a huge X with my body. The fall shook me a bit and was unpleasant, but after the 5 seconds of gliding on the snow I checked my body and had no sharp pains and was a little worried about hitting my head on the snow. Every check I did on myself told me I didn't have a concussion so I was fine and I had a little bit of pain on my left wrist, but nothing bad.

I then went on a ride along with my friend in a snowcat and got to see what he does for work after the mountain closed. Specialized heavy machinery is alwasy pretty cool to see, and it had bluetooth so we could listen to Japanese learning podcasts through his shift like it was a road trip. My wrist started feeling worse and worse as the shift continued to the point that I was worried it was broken by the time I went to bed.

### January 9 2026

I spent the day in and did not go snowboarding to let my wrist heal. I worked on my sports betting arbitrage blog and executing my arbitrage strategy. My wrist healed surprisingly quickly making me hopefuly that the injury is just a sprain and that it will be all healed up in time for my upcoming trip to Japan. I tried going for a run, but quickly postponed those plans after feeling the 0 degree air temp.

### January 10 2026

I woke up earlier than the day before, arbed a few sportsbook promos and went to my cafe to write here. Wrist feels better and I will test it out tomorrow morning to see if it healed. 

### January 11 2026

I also stayed in a coded. I spent time looking at my sports betting promo strategy and did some leetcode and went for a run. Altitude was no joke.

### January 12 2026 

I went snowboarding today. I was able to hitch a ride there and back. I did not take as many risks, so it was not as fun when I feel myself pushing my limits. I think I just need to snowboard more to get comfortable pushing myself again. 

### January 13 2026 - Tuesday 

I slept poorly the night before so I did not snowboard because I am especially scared about injuring myself after this scare with my wrist. All but one of the people living in the house where I am staying are gone, so I spent most of the day with them and went to trivia at a local bar. I met some locals, both of which are in a run club so I will try and join them next week. 


### January 15 2026 - Thursday 

Woke up, went snowboarding for a bit. Snow was hard and icy. I went over a rock and had a goofy wipe out. Thankfully, myself and the board were not damaged.

### January 16 2026 - Friday

Temperature was in the single digits to teens not accounting for windchill. There was no snow fall making this the worst year ever recorded at Copper Mountain for snowfall which is really important for skiing. It was also overcast giving what is called 'flat light'. Flat light just means that the sunlight is not strong enough to give shadows on the snow when you are riding, making the ground look like a plain sheet of white with no detectable features. This can be pretty dangerous to not be able to make out features in the snow when you are riding and can hit a random drop, groove, or jump. 

Needless to say, I opted against riding and just stayed in and played a little chess. 

### January 17 2026 - Saturday

Went skiing with a one of the roommates

### January 18 2026 - Sunday

Went skiing with some of the roommates and a new roommates new situationship. This gave me a courtside seat to the small town drama that is going on. 

### January 19 2026 - Monday

Went Skiing with dudes that live in Leadville. Ended the night going to a local steakhouse then going to a camp fire.

### January 20 2026 - Tuesday

Stayed in and just went for a run. The run was about 5k at elevation which completely destroyed me physically, but I was proud of the accomplishment. I then went to trivia and hijacked a roommates phone talking to one of their friends about anime. One of the roommates also picked up anime which I have not watched in a while, so we enjoyed watching some full metal alchemist brotherhood these past few evenings after their work.


### January 21 2026 - Wednesday 

Went skiing with one of the roommates and their new girlfriend. Looks like they tried to set me up with one of the friends who had recurring problem with a situationship. Nothing happened lol.

### January 22 2026 - Thursday

Stayed in again and did a 5k later in the evening. I watched a few speeches from the world economic forum this year. The rhetoric and sentiments being expressed by world leaders were really interesting me as I am getting into monitoring the political and economic state of the world. While listening I repaired an old beaten up snowboard that I bought for $20. A normal price for a snowboard is around $300.

### January 23 2026 - Friday 

Going riding after waking up early with a roommate. Its extra cold today so I might grab a hot coffee at the resort. My sister and mom are coming to town for the weekend, so I will meet them at their rental house this evening when they arrive. My sister and mom flew in late this night. We are staying in a nearby airbnb, so I get to sleep in a bed for the first time all month.  

### January 24 2026 - Saturday

I showed my favorite coffee shop to my sister and mom who loved it and the cute town of Leadville, CO. I then took my sister to Copper mtn and struck her a good deal on rentals and day passes for the two days that she would be skiing. She ended up needing to buy goggles after getting the rental supplies which really bugged me. Also during this time the central and eastern US is being hit by a big winter storm, so we just got a lot of snow and the snow is the best it's been all month with a good layer of fresh powder. The storm also dropped the temperature to the teens for the day when we were skiing, but our gear was good enough so this wasn't an issue. 

 She skis and I snowboard, so there was little advice I could give her to coach her down the mountain. I had to stick with her as she was getting comfortable skiing down the green runs. I had only ever experienced this combination as the noobie trying to figure out skiing and this was the first time I got to act as the experienced coach who is kinda itching to just ride at my pace, but I couldn't because I was not willing to abandon someone who is learning to ski on the mountain. Overall, I had a good time and was able to practice a couple tricks and jumps that made sense to practice at the slow speeds I needed to keep to not get away from my sister. 

 After skiing with my sister, we went to a local restaurant with my mom. My sister and I then went to see live music at a local bar and met with a bunch of our local friends and some who came up from Denver. 

 ### January 25 2026 - Sunday

Upon waking up, my sister and I checked the forcaste and saw that the high was -2 Fahrenheit. We bundled up, ate breakfast and went to the mountain so my sister can get her money's worth on the passes and rentals that she bought for the day. Thankfully lines were short and my sister was keeping up with me much better than the day before. I pressured her to go down a blue run which she was initially scared to attempt, but after only falling once  on the blue run she was glad that I pushed her with that run.

We got lunch, moved me back into my couch and said goodbye. 

### January 26 - 28 2026

The snow was bad so I just spend my time lounging around, drinking coffee and spending time with the people I'd soon be leaving. I do a little calisthenics when I get bored, and I just got my main stats up to 50 consecutive push ups and I am now doing a plank for the entire runtime of Bruno Mars' 'I just might' song which is almost exactly 3min 30sec. I will be leaving on the 29th on a 7am flight, so I will need to wake up at 3am, and at that point I'll just stay up so I can try and sleep on the flight. 

### January 29 2026 - Thursday

I travelled all day basically and did not see the sunset until the following day. I took a flight from Denver and connected through LAX onto a flight bound for Tokyo.Firstly, we had to drive about 3 hours from Leadville to Denver before boarding our first flight.  The first flight was uneventful and I fell asleep for maybe an hour or so and read a little on the plane. We got off at LAX and had about an hour layover. Los Angeles seemed like the homeland of girly sweet overpriced coffee drinks so I got myself a creme brulee latte that I soon regretted and an overpriced bland burrito with my travel buddies.

We then go on the flight to Tokyo. I sat next to a group of 19 year old kids who were going on a group trip to Japan for a week. They didn't all look like redit mod weebs, but the loudest dude in their group would regularly and incorrectly repeat common Japanese phrases that he undoubtedly heard from animes, like 'itadakimas', and 'arigato ozima'. This group of dudes was pretty funny in my opinion, so I didn't really mind that they were somewhat boisterous and obviously excited for their Japan trip. 

We crossed the international date line and I got some cool pictures of the Aleutian islands out the window seat that I somewhat regretted getting. I only got to look out the window for a good 20-30min since we mostly flew over the ocean. 

## Location 2 - Tokyo, Japan

### January 30 - Friday

We crossed the international date line and I spent the last 4 hours of my flight trying to learn Hiragana which is one of the 3 scripts that are locally used in Japan. My travel buddies and I landed in Japan and we were tired and wanted to put down our bags in our airbnb.

 We tried as a group to figure out the Tokyo subway system with all of our ski equiptment in hand. This was probably the most complicated public transit system I had experienced and in a much more foreign language than anything I saw when studying abroad in Europe 3 summers ago. I quickly learned that one of the other guys in our group had a much faster walking pace when he was able to board a train before we noticed, I got to watch the train doors close and serperate us in the Tokyo metro station - Wildly Hilarious after a 16 hours of travelling. Eventually, we made it to our place in Shinjuku, put our stuff down, and went out for some drinks and food to celebrate the beginning of our trip. 

 We really just walked into the first 2 restuarants we saw and could get away with pointing to the menu to order. We then decided to go to the famous bar district Kabukicho(probably mispelled). All the bars we saw on the street had touts that were trying to bring you in which we could see as the red flag that it was, so we ironically avoided every bar because they were trying really hard. We tried to leave in the direction of our place without wanting to stop to look up the directions to prevent someone coming up and pressuring us to do something sleezy or just get scammed. We ended up looping around a few times and never went into any of those bars and each got offered happy endings at least once per loop. 

 We then eventually left that street, oriented ourselves and started home and eventually followed a group of local looking people into a building and then an elevator. Each floor in the building had its own business, first we visited a bar that only took Japanese speakers, so we went to see another floor. The next floor was another bar that took gaijin like us and the waitresses wore only slightly more revealing uniforms that what you would see at a typical Panama City Beach bar. The hostess was a tuxedoed man who offered us not a price per drink, but a rate per hour. I understood, and it took a minute for the other guys to figure out what kind of bar we were at. We were somewhat interested, but it seemed like a waste to pay for a hostess who probably doesn't speak english, so we carried on. Keep in mind every time we visit a new floor we need to go up and down the elevator, and each time the initial bar that refused us was visited by the other people in the elevator so they got to see us in the elevator several times in the background. The next floor we tried ended up being a restuarant. We were not hungry so we stayed in the elevator and decided to leave. Before leaving the other people went to the top undescript floor that had a secret gambling rooms in it. The room was closing soon so we were not able to hop into a game of poker, so we called it and just went home to get some good sleep. 

### January 31 - Saturday

The rest of the group minus one would be arriving in Tokyo that day, so we all planned to go out again. This is the main reason we called it after a fairly uneventful night yesterday. 

In the morning we went to a cute little cafe where we got cube pastries, matcha lattes and some of the most insane french toast of my life. I ordered with one of the dozen or so Japanese words that I knew. Then we took a train over to go see the imperial palace and walked around the area only to learn that the main palace building was closed for the day and I couldn't force my way into the castle area thanks to the impressive moat and defensive structures - I'll remember to bring a seige tower next time. 

We then went to the fish market, and got some tuna and impulse bought a bunch of tuna sushi, beer and skewers. We then went to the top of Tokyo Tower, took some pictures then returned to our airbnb to rest a bit before welcoming the rest of our party. The fourth person in our airbnb arrived and it was hilarious seeing thie 6'5" frat bro from Auburn Alabama fit himself into doorwars that are 5'10" high and a bathroom that is at most 1 square meter. 

The foursome in our airbnb went to get some omakase with drinks of course. It was about as good sushi as I'd ever had, but I don't think it was worth the cost.

Writing this a few days after the fact, I genuinely think sushi is one of the most overrated dishes in the world - theres only so much you can do with raw fish and it hardly ever tastes any different or interesting. Sushi to me either tastes moderately good like with tuna where the flavor is mild and has a creamy texture or has an uncomfortable texture or flavor like with most fish that weren't the tuna. Even in the best case scenario a mild flavor and creamy texture does not impress me and I think a meal has to do a bit more than just be two increadibly basic ingredients placed together - no matter how good the branding is. That being said I made sure to eat every kind of sushi at least once to see if I can see why people speak so highly about sushi - I did not see it. We almost finished our tray, and I was only one to eat every kind of sushi which I know for certain because I was the only one to eat the tamago. We then left for bars to meet the rest of the party.

We met at a random Jazz bar. Then moved to a Japanese Barbeque place ate our fill of hot and tasty food and then went out to a karaoke place. This kind of karaoke gave private rooms with a required drink purchase we were all for. We got drinks and had a bunch of fun singing the songs that would then be stuck in everyone's head for the rest of the trip. Most of these songs were just 2000's party tracks along the lines of Katy Perry and Justin Beiber and then a few country rock songs when that one guy got to pick the song. We then went to a club and got in the wrong line so we went to this pop up event where we again got drinks listened to some edm music. Afterwards we all agreed that the music was stupid and more like a parody of edm music where there was a plain beat playing for 5 minutes that people acted like the music was good and interesting, but it really wasn't. Maybe we just needed to pop pills to understand the music which we did not do. We then went outside, chatted with some dudes over a smoke and then left to another random late night izakaya. We got food and had a ~40oz beer bottle on the table between us all for the next 5 hours which we regularly replaced and got ramen and a bunch of other food. The final bill for the 5 of us ended up being about 100 USD which was increadible to see. We took a time lapse of our group talking all night and I can be seen flipping a tooth pick in my mouth for a good majority of the video which made for a hilarious inside joke thorughout the rest of the trip.

## Location 3 - Niseko, Japan
### February 1 2026

We left the Izakaya at about 5am right as the trains were picking up and we could make our way back to the airbnb to pick up our stuff before flying to Hokkaido. We went back, I went horizontal for a good 30min and we were back at it in the Tokyo metro going to the airport with full ski bags and luggage. The airport was uneventful except for a few interesting pastries that I got. We got on our flight to New Chitose airport, slept on the plane, and then took our bus to the town of Niseko which is noticably different from the ski resorts or town surrounding the ski resorts that are also known as Niseko. The town was really cute and had 6' tall snow embakments on the side of the road. A river ran by the town which seperated us from the main town except for the two bridges that let us cross the river to get to the town.

 We unpacked our stuff when we got to the airbnb and then got some food from 7/11 which is much more high quality in Japan and thus more common. Then we figured out the sleeping arangment, I got to sleep on the traditional tatami mat room with two others. The tatami mat had a hardness between a carpetted floor and hardwood floor and we got these mats to sleep on which were about the thickness of a medium thickness sleeping bag. It was a moderately uncomfortable to sleep on the mat, but I feel that I got used to it in a night or two. Also note that each night we are either dead tired or drank ~1,000,000 beers each, so I was never not going to sleep. 

 ### February 2 2026

 Game day!!! This was the first day we got to actually snowboard. The more skilled half with avalanche safety gear went on ahead beyond the bounds of the ski resort to get the special terrain that is mostly untouched deep powdery snow. The powder is the main attraction for flying to Japan from Colorado where there is already ski resorts but nowhere near the level of powder and consistent snowfall, especially this season. Me and one of the other dudes started snowboarding on groomed terrain that is on the resort and had a great time. One of the runs even had a bit of the deep powder that the skilled group went looking after even though it was easily accessible via a lift. I learned that I did not in fact know to ski in deep powder when I wipe out and flip over my board several times on this area with about a 60 degree steepness(idk most of the words for skiing terms yet). This was totally fine even at high speeds because falling down is by far my best skill as a snowboarder and the powder cushoned you so that these falls didn't even hurt. 

 The skilled members of our group recommended I go on a run with them where they took me through some forest with powder snow which was up to knees at low points and up to my waist when it was deep. I'd say at this point I was skilled enough to attempt this type of run but not skilled enough to really excel there. I was super grateful that I had gone out of my way at Copper mountain to do ungroomed runs and moguls to get comfortable with the kinds of tight turns that these trees demanded. This was also the most risky run I had attempted where if I had fallen during a straight section of the path I would have earned the biggest risk so far - cardio. There was a good demand for tight and precise turns along with jumps that, ignoring a few spills, I think I took like a champ. We kept on going and skiied even into the night when they had these huge stadium lights illuminate the slopes. 
 
  We then went to food trucks nearby because almost all restuarants in the area, previously unbeknownst to us, required reservations, and we ate outside in the snow. We almost went home but then we found an apres ski bar in the middle of town and decided to get a couple pitchers. The bar was filled with Australian tourists which foreshadows that we  just came to Japan to party with a bunch of Aussies - not a bad deal by far.

 ### Febrary 3 2026

 The next day the skilled people checked a more technically demanding run that they thought I could do after my surprisingly good performance the day prior. The less skilled bunch of us got on the lift and went straight for the skilled bunch. I called out on the way up that this was the first time I did not take a warm up run on an easy slope and brushed off the necessity. I should have taken a practice run. On the last lift up a black run, my goggles fogged up intensely, and paired with the already low visibility of the clouds that the mountain rose into I could identify that there was snow in front of me, but I had no idea what shape the snow in front of me took on. I then went down 'cowboy style' without any goggles in one of the scarier runs of the trip as writing this. Surprisingly halfway down this somewhat terrifying run, I look up and see an on mountain cafe blasting girly J-pop music.
