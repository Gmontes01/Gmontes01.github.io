# Travel Blog - Gabriel Montes
## Dates December 2025 - June 2026

Welcome to my travel blog. Here is just a space to journal my thouhgts, and expeiences from January 2026 until I begin full time work in August 2026. I plan to journal here on my experiences in the different countries that I visit during this time and on any thoughts that I feel worth writing down. I was always weakest in english and composition type classes going through school so my expectations are low for my writing in this blog, however I want to take this blog as a chance to develop those skills because I do feel that composition is a powerful and useful skill. I'll occasionally write an essay on a topic if I really feel like it.

## Location 1 - Leadville, Colorado, USA

After graduating and spending time with my family up until Christmas, I left for Colorado to couch surf with friends in Leadville, Colorado. Leadville is located near Copper Mountain, a popular ski resort, where I plan to snowboard most days while here. Having had these friends for a while, I have already visited the mountains twice before to learn how to snowboard and meet many friends of my friends.

### December 31 2025 - Wednesday

I spent the last few days mostly snowboarding or actively spending time with friends (playing board games, playing bar games, drinking, eating, watching shows and watching movies). When I catch myself awake when nobody else is, I would leave to a local coffee shop to work on developing this blog and doing technical work for fun. Many of the people in my social circle around leadville work at Copper Mountain, which has much of its work in maintaining the skiing areas done at night, so their sleep schedules are pretty crazy. My friends are really into pro football unlike me thus giving me plenty of down time to also build this website and code while ignoring the borderline gluttunous amount of football that these guys can watch on Sundays. 

### January 1 2026 - Thursday

Happy New Year! Of course, I spent the night out with friends at a local bar in Leadville called Past Times. The local history of the Leadville as an old western mining town is really visible in almost every part of the town. This was super noticable at Past Times with the classic bar games like pool, darts, and shuffleboard in the far half of the bar and a typical college bar in the near half to the entrance with crappy mixed drinks, a young crowd and an EDM DJ setup with strobelights and loudspeakers contrasting the old western saloon aestethic of the building. Things also felt different being in a small town with most people there being at most one degree of seperation from me through my handful of local friends. This  made the bar feel more like a frat party where everyone has some relation to each other through knowing a brother where all I had to do was name drop 'Titatanium Joe', and someone will probably know who I am.

I woke up earlier than the others today, like I typically do, so I came to my favorite local cafe, City on a Hill, and wrote up this post. I cataloged a few mathy type blogs that I want to read as I spend my time exploring math and programming for fun. It's about time for me to go skiing and I'm hoping my writing will become more effortless so I can both develop these skills and write these posts more efficiently leaving me to do coding, math and language stuff. 

### January 2 2026 - Friday

Today, I am actually trying to build my optimal routine in Leadville for maximizing the value that I get out of this month. I intentially woke up early, so I could come to my cafe and do a little math or programming after I finish writing up this post. We got a few inches of snow, so I am excited about the snowboarding conditions on the mountain. I am trying to leave this cafe around 8am to try and get to the mountain before all of the fresh snow gets skiied out by the other skiiers. 

#### Thoughts on discipline

I've been thinking a good bit about the necesity of discipline for leading a fulfilling life. I have a season pass across many ski resorts so it does not bother me too much to show up to the mountain late and only get a handful of runs down the mountain and take a more chill day. For completely avoidable reasons, we got to the mountain around 2:15pm when skiing closes at 4pm and some friends of friends had to buy full day passes for full day prices to get about a eighth of a day of skiing. I bring this up not to try and shame anyone, but to add context that this experience shows me that I think these avoidable reasons just boiled down to lacking discipline and being lazy about getting up to go skiing and organizing logistics beforehand. Normally, people would argue that you can take a break from being disciplined when on vacation, but this experience seems to point to the opposite. 

 We normally think about discipline as something painful that you use to achieve your goals; sticking to a workout regiment, eating less tasty but more healthy food, and finishing up your work when you really want to go home and watch netflix. This seems to be the typical un-fun examples of discipline that come to mind where we do something unpleasant that we know is good for us, figuratively 'eating our vegetables'. However, I want to clarify to myself the idea that discipline is also necessary to wake up early to have a great day skiing, to chose to read your favorite book instead of mindlessly scrolling instagram and, for me, walk through the cold to my favorite cafe instead of sitting on the couch and binging my fifth rewatch of the Fallout show. Here dicipline still gives us some level of discomfort to realize some net gain in value, but it seems like the idea that we tie discipline solely to the discomfortable part of these decisions is leaving out a critical part of the equation. This makes me think that discipline should not be tied only to the act of paying, but we should try to associate it more with the pleasant parts where we reap the rewards of our discipline. More formally, discipline allows us to extract leveraged value from accepting some discomforts. Thus to me, it is more useful and accurate to view discipline as our strength to excert our own will power to reach for the things that we want. 
 
 Furthermore, this view on discipline seems most consistent with my outlook on my own current situation in life. Intuitively, it is obvious that I should not waste this unique time in my life where I have youth, extended freetime and financing by bed-rotting on my phone and binging 100 different shows, but I should exert my will on my life through discipline and go travel to see friends, wake up early to go skiing and spend my money on these great experiences when I would rather save or invest it. Contrary to the popular concensus on discipline, from my reasoning, I should take this time off and the uniqueness of this time in my life to go out and be as disciplined as possible so that I can gain as much value out of this time rather than just 'take it easy' like I saw my friends do when they dragged their feet getting to the skiing. 

### January 3 2026 - Saturday

I woke up early joined one of the friends roommates onto the slopes. I am confident snowboarding and controlling myself as I go down the mountain. The next step for me is to work on riding switch which is the opposite orientation as I am used to, gain confident hitting small jumps, and attempting a jump switch where you just jump up and do a 180 degree turn. We snowboarded for about 3 runs before the line for one lift started would stretch to another lift. We both have Ikon season passes so we just called it and got home after a light day of snowboarding before noon.

I learned there is a pretty nice gym that is walking distance from me so I'll likely buy a membership and soon. Most of the people in Leadville that I know work on weekends so there is not a lot to do tonight. 

### January 4 2026 - Sunday

Most people that I know are taking a break from skiing to watch football today since they ski most of the season anyways. This works for me since I recently have gained a good bit of confidence skiing and I started snowboarding more intensely. Because of this, my muscles and joints are feeling more sore so a day off will do me some good. 

I also noticed a good bit of large promotions in sports betting ads that I would see in the football my friends were watching. Exploiting these promotions to give myself arb or a positive EV to finance my future travels seems like a valuable excercise dealing with variance and market mechanics leading into my trading job. 

I am fully aware that these promotions are designed to get people hooked on gambling and I am confident that I can analyze and intellectualize these bets to the point were it will feel like homework thus taking the addictive thrill out of gambling. Also since I intend to view this as an academic excercise I will likely be gambling on events that are more obscure which I do NOT plan to watch, unless I can find a compelling reason to bet on popular events(i.e tighter spreads). This will likely also cut down on the addictivness of the gambling and even if these bets are being placed on popular events like the super bowl I plan to arb out any risk so that I am hedged given the outcome and I only collect the edge that is guaranteed from my strategy. This strategy will only work while I am in Colorado since gambling on these sites are only legal in certain states, so after a month, when I leave Colorado, I must cash out and stop sports bettin. This will likely give me enough time to exploit the new "customer" offers and not give enough time for the gambling sites to catch on to my activities and thus ban me. I will publish my strategy and thoughts in a technical blog post, so look there if you would like to see more about my approach to this. 

### January 5 2026 - Monday

Decent out on the mountain. I was able to hitch a ride to and from the mountain around the beginning and end of the day so I spent the whole day snowboarding and listening to 'flash boys' on audio book. It's just nerdy enough to stop me from giving off any cool ski bum vibes. My friends and I went to a local steakhouse, Quicy's, and had an incredible meal for like 30$ with watermelon margaritas that were unnecessarily good. The restuarant had one thing on the menu: Steak. The menu did give us the option of 4 sizes, how well done we want it, and that was it. The cut of steak is determined by the weekday and that is my favorite type of restuarant.  

### January 6 2026 - Tuesday

It was still my friend's weekend and it snowed the night before so everyone was excited to go to the mountain and enjoy the 'pow day'. I enjoyed the powder and got worked super hard going over moguls. I then let myself get talked into going to another local restuarant, The Famous. This is one of my favorite Italian restuarants(including the one's I visited in Italy). It was a good meal even though I was sore I got to come home and fall off rainbow road while playing Mario Kart with the roommates of where I was staying.

### January 7 2026 - Wednesday

I was sore and had plenty of skiing so I skipped going to Copper Mountain. I decided to actual implement the sports betting arbitraging strategy to exploit new player promotions. It was pretty scary moving around the amount of money that I was moving, but I ended up making a tidy profit on a few promos.

 I also got more comfortable making smaller plays for little bits of arbitrage across sites which is good because I am going to need to make much bigger plays with some of the larger promos before these sites figure out what I am doing and ban me. My goals are to analyze data to find a way to smartly gamble short parlay's which these sites like to advertise a lot because parlays make a lot of money for these sites(and lose a lot for their customers). I also want to find a scheme for trading live. Live trading seems more risky as the numbers are moving constantly and execution speed is both crutial and limited, but it would be a good excercise. I will not trade anything besides arbitrage on promos until I thoroughly understand these other bet types and make a technical post about it.

### January 8 2026 - Thursday

The plan was, I wake up, go to a coffee shop, snowboard a little, hitch a ride back to Leadville, do some coding or math. I went to City on a Hill, snowboarded for about 2 or 3 hours. I went off my first park jump with the technique of a 5 year old. Then I did some normal snowboarding and had a pretty bad fall. I was going around 20-25mph by my guess and I must have caught my front edge trying a little ollie and suddenly I was sliding face down on some packed snow with my limbs making a huge X with my body. The fall shook me a bit and was unpleasant, but after the 5 seconds of gliding on the snow I checked my body and had no sharpe pains and was a little worried about hitting my head on the snow. Every check I did on myself told me I didn't have a concussion so I was fine and I had a little bit of pain on my left wrist, but nothing bad.

I then went on a ride along with my friend in a snowcat and got to see what he does for work after the mountain closed. Specialized heavy machinery is alwasy pretty cool to see, and it had bluetooth so we could listen to Japanese learning podcasts through his shift like it was a road trip. My wrist started feeling worse and worse as the shift continued to the point that I was worried it was broken by the time I went to bed.

### January 9 2026

I spent the day in and did not go snowboarding to let my wrist heal. I worked on my sports betting arbitrage blog and executing my arbitrage strategy. My wrist healed surprisingly quickly making me hopefuly that the injury is just a sprain and that it will be all healed up in time for my upcoming trip to Japan. I tried going for a run, but quickly post poned those plans after feeling the 0 degree air temp.

### January 10 2026

I woke up earlier than the day before, arbed a few sportsbook promos and went to my cafe to write here. Wrist feels better and I will test it out tomorrow morning to see if it healed. 

### January 11 2026

I also stayed in a coded. I spent time looking at my sports betting promo strategy and did some leetcode and went for a run. Altitude was no joke.

### January 12 2026 

I went snowboarding today. I was able to hitch a ride there and back. I did not take as many risks, so it was not as fun when I feel myself pushing my limits. I think I just need to snowboard more to get comfortable pushing myself again. 

### January 13 2026 - Tuesday 

I slept bad the night before so I did not snowboard because I am especially scared about injuring myself after this scare with my wrist. All but one of the people living in the house where I am staying are gone, so I spent most of the day with them and went to trivia at a local bar. I met some locals, both of which are in a run club so I will try and join them next week. 

### January 14 2026 - Wednesday 

I have some big positions that I need take out in my sports betting system. For those that don't read the technical posts, I did the math so I am guaranteed payout if I do things right. I am going to optimize myself so that I do not mess things up, meaning I am most likely not going to make it snowboarding.
